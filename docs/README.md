# Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Cillers Init system components.

## Overview

The Cillers Init system is designed to initialize and configure distributed systems components across different environments. It provides automated setup and configuration management for:

- **Redpanda**: High-performance streaming platform (Kafka-compatible)
- **Couchbase**: Distributed NoSQL document database

## Documentation Files

### [Redpanda Documentation](redpanda.md)
Complete guide to configuring Redpanda topics including:
- Topic creation and management
- Partition and replication configuration
- Retention policies and cleanup strategies
- Environment-specific settings
- Performance optimization examples

### [Couchbase Documentation](couchbase.md)
Complete guide to configuring Couchbase resources including:
- Bucket, scope, and collection management
- Memory quota and replication settings
- TTL (Time-To-Live) configuration
- Multi-tenant organization patterns
- Environment-specific configurations

## Configuration Philosophy

Both systems follow a consistent configuration approach:

1. **Global Defaults**: Base settings applied to all resources
2. **Item Defaults**: Resource-specific defaults that override global settings
3. **Environment Overrides**: Environment-specific settings that override all defaults

This hierarchical approach allows for:
- Consistent baseline configurations
- Flexible per-resource customization
- Environment-specific optimizations
- Easy maintenance and updates

## Environment Support

The system supports multiple environments with different configurations:
- **Development**: Optimized for local development with minimal resources
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Production**: High-availability, high-performance configuration

## Getting Started

1. Review the specific documentation for each component
2. Examine the example configurations provided
3. Adapt the examples to your specific use case
4. Test configurations in development before deploying to production

## Best Practices

- Start with the provided examples and modify as needed
- Use environment-specific overrides for resource scaling
- Monitor resource usage and adjust quotas accordingly
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Follow security best practices for production deployments
